    proceedings, and reports, about sixty projects, 
    and six major programs.</p>

    <p class="life">She coined the term "software engineering",
    stating "I began to use the term 'softwaare engineering'
    to distinguish it from hardware and other kinds of 
    engineering, yet treat each type of engineering 
    as part of the overall systems engineering process."

    Michiganin in 1995 before transferring to Earlham College,
    where her mother had been a student.
